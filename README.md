# Next Top Robot

  By the end of 2021, there will be **3,788,000** robots. This is nearly a million more units compared to the amount of robots counted in 2019. If you were to purchase a new robot every day, it would take you over **10,000** years to aqcuire each robots, and by then the world would probably be own by them. Obviously, this isn't feasible for robot-loving fanatics at Mondo Robot.

<div align="left">  


  Hi! I am **Andrew Vallejo** and I did this project in order to show off my qualifications and skills to the kind people at Mondo Robots. At this time, I've been in school at Turing for 5 months. A month ago I would not be able to complete this project within the alotted week. It wasn't only knowledge I was given but rather the ability to find solutions on my own.

 My challenges

 <sub>

  This project presented challenges with each iteration. I had never used an API that had a key. I never heard of bearer tokens. I've never dealt with a real-like registration and authorization before. Nor worked with so many moving parts considering most elements in the App rely on communicating with the API. I also did not have project check-ins or the support of others as I would in school.

  The hardest element was understanding how to get the API to work and what to do with the bearer tokens. I'll admit much of that didn't make sense as I thought the bearer token were unique to the user, therefore the API recognize if they were admin or not. It wasn't until I implemented an auto-login featurethat I finally understood how the whole system works. 

  The most frustrating part of the project was actually getting the vote buttons to work correctly. The goal was when you vote for one robot, it's button would become disbaled. If you voted for another robot, it would become disabled and reenable the last one. Finding the solution was like having a house with a hundred lights, where some switches were connected to more than one lightbulb socket, and your job was to turn them all off but one. This was due because I decided earlier on when I made the button components that they would rely on boolean values from state to determine their functionality.
