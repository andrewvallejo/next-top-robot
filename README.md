# Next Top Robot

  By the end of 2021, there will be **3,788,000** robots. This number is nearly a million more units compared to the number of robots counted in 2019. If you were to purchase a new robot every day, it would take you over **10,000** years to acquire each robot, and by then, the world would probably be owned by them. Knowing the statistics, this was not feasible for robot-loving fanatics at Mondo Robot.

  Disclaimer about the project
  </summary>
  This project is a skill test designed by Mondo Robot to gauge competency in front-end development. My task was to fulfill all of the project's features by accessing the API provided and building a website within seven days. The front end also matched the wireframe, including the three media breakpoints: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

<div align="left">  


  Hi! I am **Andrew Vallejo** and I did this project to show off my qualifications and skills to the kind people at Mondo Robots. At this time, I've been in school at Turing for five months. A month ago, I would not be able to complete this project within the allotted week. It wasn't only the foundation of knowledge but rather the ability to find solutions on my own.

 My challenges
  </summary>

  <br>

   
 <sub>

  This project presented challenges with each iteration. I had never used an API that had a key. I never heard of bearer tokens. I've never dealt with a real-like registration and authorization before. Nor worked with so many moving parts considering most elements in the App rely on communicating with the API. I also did not have project check-ins or the support of others as I would in school.

  The most complex element was understanding the API's login features and understanding what to do with bearer tokens. I'll admit much of that didn't make sense as I thought the bearer token was unique to the user; therefore, the API recognize if they were admin or not. It wasn't until I implemented an auto-login feature that I finally understood how the whole system works. 

  The most frustrating part of the project was getting the vote buttons to work correctly. The goal was when you vote for one robot; its vote button would become disabled. If you voted for another robot, it would become disabled and reenable the last one. Finding the solution was like having a house with a hundred lights, where some switches were attached to more than one lightbulb socket, and your job was to turn them all off but one. This travesty was due because I decided earlier on when I made the button components that they would rely on boolean values from state to determine their functionality.
