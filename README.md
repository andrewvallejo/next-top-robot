![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17935770/129827835-7649f2e6-cd28-4206-b3f7-4788e09ba53f.png)                   

By the end of 2021, there will be **3,788,000** robots. This is nearly a million more units compared to the amount of robots counted in 2019. If you were to purchase a new robot every day, it would take you over **10,000** years to aqcuire robots. Obviously, this isn't feasible for robot-loving fanatics at Mondo Robot.
